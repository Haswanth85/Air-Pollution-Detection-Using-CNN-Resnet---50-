# Air Pollution Detection Using CNN
 Air Pollution Detection Using CNN A project leveraging a ResNet-50 CNN model to predict air quality indices from images. Built using Python, this tool analyzes satellite and phone-captured images and includes a Tkinter-based GUI for user interaction. It also supports live image capture via webcam.  Features: Predicts air quality index from static or live images. Built with ResNet-50 for high accuracy. GUI for easy interaction, built using Tkinter. Real-time image capture and analysis with OpenCV. Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow, ResNet-50 Tkinter (GUI), OpenCV (Image Capture) Google Colab (Model Training)
